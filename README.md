# Getting Started

Within the root of your React Native project, open the `app.json` or (if using Expo) `app.config.js` file and add the following keys with the IDs from the Tapsell console:

```json
{
  "react-native-tapsell-mediation": {
    "TapsellMediationAppKey": "xxxxxxxx",
    "TapsellMediationAdmobAdapterSignature": "ca-app-pub-xxxxxxxx~xxxxxxxx",
    "TapsellMediationApplovinAdapterSignature": "xxxxxxxx",
    "TapsellMediationAppMarket": "xxxx"
  }
}
```
